## CTDA Metadata Sets  

The sets are either from a harvest or query of Dublin Core and/or MODS, Metadata Object Description Schema, records. Sets are arranged chronologically and by encoding type, DC or MODS. All CTDA metadata falls under a CCO license.  
The Dublin Core sets have been transformed into csv files. Each file contains the data for an institution.  
The MODS are the raw MODS harvested and are in a zip file.
